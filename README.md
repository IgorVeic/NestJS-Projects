# ðŸŽµ Swaggify Music App
Swaggify is a full-featured music application built with NestJS, offering a scalable and efficient backend structure. The app leverages Swagger for API documentation, Postman for API testing, and PostgreSQL (managed via pgAdmin) for the database.

Key Features âœ¨

- Database: Swaggify uses PostgreSQL with TypeORM to define relations between entities like Artists, Albums, and Songs.
- Authentication: Includes user authentication with JWT and guards to protect routes.
- DTOs & Validation: Data transfer objects (DTOs) ensure proper input validation using NestJS pipes.
- API Documentation: The entire API is documented using Swagger, providing a clean interface to explore and test endpoints.
- Relations: Strong relations between Artists, Albums, and Songs allow seamless navigation and management of music data.
- Enums & Decorators: Enums are used for defining constant values across the app, while decorators are employed to enhance the functionality of classes and methods.
